# Buu342's Weapon Base 2

<img src=".github/action.gif" width="600" height="337"/>

This is a complete remake of my original weapon base.</br></br>
The original was buggy, contained code from a myriad of sources, and in general was a mess to maintain. I've been trying to refurbish it for quite some time, with this version being the final one that I'm happy to release to the wild.</br></br>
I've done the best I could to keep the code as clean as possible, commenting whenever I could. This should hopefully contain a lot of cool stuff for people to learn from!</br></br>

### Features

* Flashlight that follows the gun (Also in thirdperson)
* Idle, holster, ironsight, and empty animation support
* Lua based animations, including breathing, idle, bobbing, swaying, crouching, and jumping
* Ammo being given during animation, instead of at the end
* Clientside magazine dropping
* Holding breath while scoping with ALT

* Lots of clientside and serverside settings, also available in the Q menu
* Thirdperson animations
